	\frametitle{Motivation to Data Layers (Solution Thinking)}
	
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item How can we think about a data solution or challenges in the data products?
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Requirements analysis.
			\item Identify the problem (challenges).
			\item Think about how to overcome the challenges.
			\item Ask your self the following questions:
			\begin{itemize}[<+->]
				\item Can we solve the problem using the current data structure by adding new features?
				\item What if we enhance/change the data structure or modeling?
				\item Could it help if we change the backend engine \forexample (DBMS system)?
			\end{itemize}			
		\end{itemize}
		\item To answer these questions you need to understand the \textbf{\underline{data layers}}.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Data Layers (Abstraction)}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Any data product (database) contains multi-layers.
		\item Each layer responsible for different tasks and operations.
		\item Each layer interacts with (hardware or software or mixed).
		\item Eliminate the complexity of data interactions; not all internal processes are shared or available for the user.
		\item The developer for each layer hides irrelevant internal details from the developer (users). 
		\item The process of \textbf{\underline{\blue{hiding}}} irrelevant details from the developer (user) is called data \textbf{\underline{\blue{abstraction}}}.
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Data Layers (Abstraction)}
	\begin{definition}
		\textbf{Data Abstraction and Data Independence}: DBMS comprises complex data-structures. To make the system efficient in terms of retrieval of data and reduce complexity in terms of usability of users, developers use abstraction i.e., hide irrelevant details from the users. This approach simplifies database design.

	\end{definition}	
	%Capacity of changing in one level without affecting the other levels. Copied but forget from where!!!
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item There are 3 levels of data abstraction.
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Physical Level
			\item Logical/Conceptual Level.
			\item View Level.

			\item Lowest level.
			\item Describes \textbf{\underline{\blue{how}}} data is stored.
			\item Describes the data structure.
			\item It allows you to modify the lowest level (Physical part) without any change in the logical schema. These change could be
				\begin{itemize}[<+->]				
					\item Using a new storage device
					\item Change the structure of the data used for storage
					\item Change the file type or use a different storage structure
					\item Chang the access method
					\item Modify indexes
					\item Change the compression algorithm or hashing technique.

\frametitle{Motivation to the Data Warehouse (DWH)}

\begin{definition}[What is Data Warehousing?] A DWH is a technique for collecting and managing data from varied sources to \textbf{provide meaningful business insights}. It is a blend of technologies and components which aids the strategic use of data.%\footnotemark
\end{definition}

%REF
Inmon Bill gave the real concept. He is considered the father of the DWH. He had written about a variety of topics for building, usage, and maintenance of the warehouse \& the Corporate Information Factory

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation to the Data Warehouse (DWH)}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item The DWH is not a product but an environment.
	\item It is a process of transforming data into information and make it available to users in a \textbf{timely manner} to make a difference.
	\item It is an architectural construct of an information system that provides users with current and historical decision support information which is difficult to access or present in the traditional operational data store.
	\item The DWH is the core of the BI system built for data analysis and reporting.

Types of Data Warehouse
\begin{description}
\item [\textbf{Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDWH)}] It provides decision support service across the enterprise. It offers a unified approach for organizing and representing data (DWH Model). It offers data classifications according to the subject with privileges policy.
\item [\textbf{Operational Data Store (ODS):}] is a central database that provides an up-to-date (real-time) data from multiple transnational systems for operational reporting into a single DWH.

%% for real time questions and answers. call ODS using intermidiate data store. DWH is day -1 (billing & subscribtions). Oracle (Loading or headache) && CDC capture change interest column not row
\item [\textbf{Data Mart:}] A data mart is a subset of the data warehouse. It specially designed for a particular line of business, such as sales, finance, sales or finance. In an independent data mart, data can collect directly from sources.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item A telecommunication company named \textbf{XTec}.
\newline
\item They have lots of systems. One of this systems is a CRM system as example of operational DB.
\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item The CRM system handles the customer activities with the company including (sales, change in customer plans, and other activities).
\item This system has a backend database (MySQL).
\item CRM team can report their sales and customer activities from their database.
\item Product owner can take a decision based on their system backend reports.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Use case (DWH)}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item What is the need for DWH?		
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This company has other systems \forexample billing, charging, signaling.	
\item They need to report information related to the CRM, billing, and signaling source systems in one report.
\item So, they need to ingest (transfer) the data from the source systems to one single database.
\item The decision from the DHW is a \textbf{global and strategical decision.}
\item If the company needs to build a machine learning model which needs data from different sources. They need to load the data from a centralized database rather than read each source alone.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Use case (ODS)}

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item So, What is the challenge for this system?
			\begin{itemize}[<+->]		
				\item It needs specific information from different source systems.
				\item It requires to track the source system database changes or update in real-time.
				\item It's functionality is based on the aggregate data not the transactions \forexample (It needs the total outgoing calls till time or it needs the total charging amounts from prepaid or the available limits from billing if it is postpaid).
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Use case (ODS)}

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item ODS is based on change data capture (CDC). This approach used to determine the data change and apply action based on this change.

        	(hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)}.
        	
        	\item Subject-oriented: \textit{DWH main target is to support business needs for
        	the whole organization including (decision-makers, departments, and
        	specific user requirements)}.
        	
        	\item Non-Volatile: \textit{It refers to the data that erased or deleted (It could be archived and retrieved when needed). Data can be accumulated daily the new snapshots (refreshed at based on the source system interval.  \faArrowCircleORight \space It could be updated daily, weekly, and monthly)}.

		\item It the dimension which changes over time. So, for a specific date we have different value.
		\item It has different types as following
		    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Type 0 (Fixed Dimension): We don't change the current even the source changes. 
        \item Type 1 (No History): No history is maintained only the latest replace the current.
        \item Type 2 (History): Series of history of records are maintained.
        \item Type 3 (Hybrid): Only the last Change and the Current new change is stored
        \item Type 4 : We split the data into two tables, first the current record and second is the historical (most common usage).
    \end{itemize}

Implementing this scenarios when we have less different of attributes. However, this implementation is not recommended because of the table size, performance, and maintenance.
			\item [Generic Design] In this approach we will create a single fact table and single dimension with the common attributes. The problem of this design we will report or care about the common attributes only.

	\item Fact table should contains one-to-one relationship with the dimension. So, we introduce the \textbf{\textit{Bridge table}} when we need to related multiple dimensions values with one record.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Patients can have multiple diagnoses.
		\item Students can have multiple majors.
		\item customers can have multiple account.
		\item Authors can have multiple publications.

The star schema is the simplest type of Data Warehouse schema. It is also known as Star Join Schema and is optimized for querying large data sets.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Schema Types: Star schema}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Characteristics of Star Schema:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Every dimension in a star schema is represented with the only one-dimension table.
		\item The dimension table should contain the set of attributes.
		\item The dimension table is joined to the fact table using a foreign key
		\item The dimension table are not joined to each other
		\item Fact table would contain key and measure
		\item The Star schema is easy to understand and provides optimal disk usage.
		\item The dimension tables are not normalized. For instance, in the above figure, Country\_ID does not have Country lookup table as an OLTP design would have.
		\item The schema is widely supported by BI Tools

		\item The main benefit of the snowflake schema it uses smaller disk space.
		\item Easier to implement a dimension is added to the Schema
		\item Due to multiple tables query performance is reduced
		\item The primary challenge that you will face while using the snowflake Schema is that you need to perform more maintenance efforts because of the more lookup tables.
