    \frametitle{What is ETL?}

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item The ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) is main core function for any data engineering (DWH) team.
        \item This team takes the delivered output from the previous stage (data modeling) and start to implement the mapping.
        \item The implementation of the ETL preferred to be unified across the team members and the organization unless there is a special case of license of capacity.

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Successful ETL design have the following characteristics:
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Maintainable.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Reusable.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Well-Performed.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Reliable.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Resilient.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Secure.

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item To implement the previous characteristics you need to have the following:
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Logging.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Auditing.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Data Lineage.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Modularity.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Atomicity.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Error Handling.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Managing Bad Data (Rejection Handling).
