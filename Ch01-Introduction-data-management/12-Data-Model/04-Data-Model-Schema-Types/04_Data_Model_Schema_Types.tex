\midTitle{Schema Types: Star Schema}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Star Schema Characteristics}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item \textbf{Simplicity}: It is the simplest type of DWH schemas.
		\item \textbf{Query effectiveness}: Because of simplicity, It needs less join to query the data (It is optimized to query large dataset).
		\item \textbf{Data Redundancy and Large Table Size}: Due to de-normalization it has a data redundancy and the table size is very huge.
		\item \textbf{Most} used and \textbf{widely} supported.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Star Schema Characteristics}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Dimensions represented by one one-dimension table.
		\item The dimension table are not joined to each other
		\item Fact table would contains key and measure.
		\item Data integrity is not enforced due de-normalized structure.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Star Schema Characteristics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Extension}: Snowflake is an extension of the Star Schema.
		\item \textbf{Normalized}: Dimension tables are normalized this means every dimension could be expanded into additional tables.
		\item \textbf{Disk Space Efficiency}: Due to its normalization methodology it uses less desk space which enhance the query as we scan less data size.
		\item \textbf{Complicated}: Due to the normalization query needs to join more table in some cases to get the data which reduces the performance.
