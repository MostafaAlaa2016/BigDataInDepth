    %The dimension can also contain one or more hierarchical relationships
    \begin{description}[<+->]
        \item[Conformed Dimensions]    the dimension which is \underline{\textit{identical}} and has the \underline{\textit{same meaning}} across many fact tables which it relates and used in different areas of the warehouse.
        \begin{example}
            \begin{itemize}[<+->]
                \item \underline{\textbf{(Date as a Key)}}: if we have a date column across many facts, we could use the date as key in all tables. So, it should be a unified format.
                \item \underline{\textbf{(Product-Id as a Key)}}: if we have a product name which could vary between systems
                \forexample (upper/lower) We can create a dimension table for the product details and use product id unified across fact tables.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{example}
