### Snowflake Dimensions

-   Snowflake Dimension is a dimension that has a hierarchy of
    attributes. This attribute is normalized, and each dimension has a
    relationship with another hierarchy dimension table.

-   This dimension design not recommended as it has much complexity to the model and query performance. Also, it complicates the ETL process and makes too many dimensions without needs
