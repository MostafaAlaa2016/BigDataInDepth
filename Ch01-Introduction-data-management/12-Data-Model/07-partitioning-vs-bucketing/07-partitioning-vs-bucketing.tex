	\frametitle{Partitioning Pros vs Cons}
	
Partition: Split huge amount of data into parts(directories for example) based on specified table column (s).

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Pros
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Distribute execution load horizontally.
			\item Number of partitions are based on the number of unique partition column.
			\item Faster execution of queries in case filter based on partition value instead of scan the entire table.
		\end{itemize}
	
		\item Cons
			\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Limitation for number of partition.
			\item It can lead to performance issue in case too many small partitions.
		\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Bucketing Pros vs Cons}
	
Bucketing split data into equal parts based on column value. 
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Pros
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Map side join will be faster because all partitions are equal.
			\item Faster query response like partitioning
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item Cons
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Number of buckets needs to be defined manual by the developers.
		\end{itemize}
