\frametitle{What is multi-temperature Storage?}

\begin{wideitemize}
\item (Most of) DWH solution design has multi-temperature data management model.
\item What is the multi-temperature data management model?
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item It is a data classification design which allows us to have the following characteristics
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item  (high performance) access on the frequent data (Hot data).
		\item Good (average performance) access to less-frequently data (warm data).
		\item Availability to access rarely accessed data (cold data).
	\end{itemize}
	\item Who is responsible for data temperature classifications?
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Demand team, product owner, or data architect (Based on the business needs).

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Why do we need the multi-temperature data management model?
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Cost reduction \blue{\faDollar \faDollar \faDollar \faDollar}
\item Performance.

\frametitle{How to implement a multi-temperature storage system? }

\begin{wideitemize}
\item How to implement the multi-temperature data management model?
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Before implementation, we need to know the following:
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Frequency of access
\item Data change rate.
\end{itemize}
\item Identify which storage type is suitable for the project
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item We store the hot data on the fast storage system.
\item Warm data (usual) stored on slightly slower storage.
\item We store the cold data on the slowest storage.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{How to implement a multi-temperature storage system? Cont.}

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Design consideration to make the retention easily.
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Table partitions need to be split based on the retention policy plan \forexample (date).
\item Summary tables (agg) need to be maintained to reduce the need for access the cold storage.
\item Backup, Recovery, and Rollback plans need to be automated and prepared/tested before moving the data.
\end{itemize}
