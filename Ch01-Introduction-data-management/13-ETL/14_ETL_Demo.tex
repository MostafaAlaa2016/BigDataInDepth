%		\item Notes:
%		\begin{itemize}
%				\item 		All examples are not related to actual company data; however, it simulates the real use case.
%				\item 		The code covers some topics and tools which we are plan to explain it in detail later in this course. 
%				\item 		Focus on the pipeline and the idea, not the actual code.
%				\item 		We wrote the code into two steps, first, implement the customized use case then think about the generalized case.

		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Parsing input data is different than validate its schema.
			\item We verify the data type and nullable check for schema validation.
			\item Other validations are related to business, and we could introduce business rejection records.
