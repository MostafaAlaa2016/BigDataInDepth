    \frametitle{What is ETL?}

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item The ETL is the process of
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item  \textbf{Extracting}: the data from one or more source system
            \item  \textbf{Transformation}: then apply some rules over this data including
            \begin{itemize}[<+->]
                \item Cleansing ex: remove null, or trim spaces.
                \item Drop duplicates.
                \item joining with lookups to validate values.
                \item Reshaping.
                \item Adding new columns or removing columns to these data.
                \item Change of data granularity.
                \item Convert data types.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Loading}: Then loading this data into target table based on the required format..
        \end{itemize}
        \item The ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) is main core function for any data engineering (DWH) team.
        \item This team takes the delivered output from the previous stage (data modeling) and start to implement the mapping.
        \item The implementation of the ETL preferred to be unified across the team members and the organization unless
        there is a special case of license of capacity.

    \frametitle{Why?}

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Why ETL has become mandatory in any DWH systems? because of the rapidly increase in the data volumes,
        and the variety of the data types structure, semi-structure, and non-structure data.

    \frametitle{ETL Characteristics}
    %%
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Successful ETL design have the following characteristics:
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Maintainable.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Reusable.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Well-Performed.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Reliable.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Resilient.
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Secure.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{ETL Best Practice}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item To implement the previous characteristics you need to have the following:
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Logging.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Auditing.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Data Lineage.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Modularity.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Atomicity.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Error Handling.

            \item [\faCheckSquareO] Managing Bad Data (Rejection Handling).
