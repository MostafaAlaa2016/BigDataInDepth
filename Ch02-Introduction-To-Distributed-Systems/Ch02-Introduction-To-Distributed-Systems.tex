	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item Assume we have a file contains \textbf{\underline{1TB}} of text lines, and we need to calculate the word count across the document, for example, \textcolor{offyellow}{The cat came back the very next day} -> \textcolor{brown}{(the, 2), (cat,1), (came,1), (back, 1), (very, 1), (next, 1), (day, 1)}.

		\item One of the distributed architecture solutions for this problem is to use \textcolor{offyellow}{\textit{map-reduce}}.

	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item Assume we need to launch a high-throughput bulk-production sandwich shop. 
		\item This sandwich has a lot of raw ingredients, and our target is to produce the sandwich as quickly as possible.
		\item To make the production very quickly we need to distribute the tasks between the  \textcolor{offyellow}{\textit{workers}}.

	\frametitle{The basic idea of MapReduce}
	We break this into three stages
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item Map.
		\item Shuffle/Group (Mapper Intermediates).
		\item Reduce			
	\end{itemize}

	We distribute our raw ingredients amongst the workers.

	We will organise and group the processed ingredients into piles, so that making a sandwich becomes easy.
