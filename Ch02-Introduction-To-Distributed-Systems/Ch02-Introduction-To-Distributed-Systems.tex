\subsection{Design Simple Distributed System (Case Study Example 1)}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Case Study Example 1}
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item Assume we have a file contains \textbf{\underline{1TB}} of text lines, and we need to convert the text to be the upper case, for example (The -> THE).
		\item We need to design the program without using any ready distributed system framework.
		\item You can use any number (n) of machines. Assume n specs are 8 GB of memory, hard desk 128 GB, and 2 cores of CPU.

	\begin{itemize} [<+->]
		\item How do we distribute the data across the nodes?
		\item How do we know the number of active nodes?
		\item How do we know if some tasks are stucking?
		\item How do we track the tasks passed to the nodes?
		\item What will happen if this box is down? How can we avoid this?
