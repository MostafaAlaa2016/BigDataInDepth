\subsection{Design Simple Distributed System (Case Study Example 1)}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Case Study Example 1}
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item Assume we have a file contains \textbf{\underline{1TB}} of text lines, and we need to convert the text to be the upper case, for example (The -> THE).
		\item We need to design the program without using any ready distributed system framework.
		\item You can use any number (n) of machines. Assume n specs are 8 GB of memory, hard desk 128 GB, and 2 cores of CPU.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Management box}
	Before going throw the management box, let's ask some questions about the management box.
	\begin{itemize} [<+->]
		\item How do we distribute the data across the nodes?
		\item How do we know the number of active nodes (or the status of the nodes)?
		\item How do we know if some tasks are stucking?
		\item How do we track the tasks passed to the nodes?
		\item What will happen if this box is down? How can we avoid this?
		\item How do we track the available resources (containers) in our cluster?

	\frametitle{File System}
	\begin{itemize} [<+->]
        \item How can we store a massive amount of data in distributed systems?
        \item How can we design a file system which supports highly fault-tolerant?
        \item Do we require special hardware to design a distributed storage system?
        \item How can we design storage systems to support distributed processing?
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Data nodes}
	\begin{itemize} [<+->]
        \item How datanodes continuously communicate with the management node?
        \item How datanodes receive the tasks instructed by the management node?
        \item Can datanodes store data besides their roles for processing?
